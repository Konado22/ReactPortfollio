            <h6 class="card-subtitle text-light " id="bio">Hello My Name is Jesse Draper. I am a 26 year old student
                currently attending a Full Stack Web Development course through the University Of Denver. This has been
                an important milestone in my life, as I have strongly desired a career change for some time and have
                always been interested in coding/web development. During this
                course I have been able to gain exposure to many different web languages and applications! Web
                development also meshes well with skills I utilized in previous jobs in hospitality and hospitality
                management. Some of these skills include problem
                solving, working with teams, coordinating projects, as well as managing my time effectively. I have
                really enjoyed the experiences i have gained and have provided some examples of the work i have
                completed below. The list is continuosly updated with projects i feel more accuratley reflect my skills
                and interests.Feel free to
                click them to see the deployed acitivities/respective github links. Feel free to contact me below for
                more information!
